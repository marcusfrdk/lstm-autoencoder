# LSTM Autoencoder

This is a simple implementation of an LSTM autoencoder built without the use of any deep learning libraries. The main goal of this project is to learn what an LSTM autoencoder is and how it works at a deeper level. The implementation is done in Python and is used in anomaly detection for educational purposes.
